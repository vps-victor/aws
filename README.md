# AWS ARCHITECTURE 

## Abstraction  
![aws_abstractions]()

**`NETWORK`**
- Types of Cloud `Private` (own), `Public` (services), `Hybrid` (mix)
- `Autos-caling` manage EC2 based on user-defined policies
- `Elastic Load Balancing` distributes incoming traffic
- `Virtual Private Cloud` Virtual Network to isolates own services
- `Direct Connect` host to aws without going through the internet
- `Rout 53` scalable & highly available DNS (and registration) (run at port 53). 

**`COMPUTING SERVICES`**
- `EC2` virtual server with resizable compute capacity
- `Elastic Beanstak` deploy and managing containers for working w/ web applications
- `Lambda` stateless serverless event-driven system
- `S3` secure, scalable, and durable storage of data objects (flat file)
  - standart, Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, Glacier DA 

- STARTING STEPS
  - (0) CREAT & ADD Credit Card
  - (1) ROOT ACC > Config MFA to the root acc
  - (2) CONFIG ADM IAM + CREATE ADM ACC + MFA
  - (3) CREATE > Group + Polices + Groups + Roles
  - (4) ADD + BIND users to 3st Step

- [AWS Total Cost Calculator](https://calculator.aws/)
- AWS drive of cost
  - Storage (always) + instance running=yes (instance stoped=no) + Instance type + pricing model +
  - Load balancing + Detailed monitoring + Elastic IP (max. 1/enabled EC2) + Paid OS & Software Package
- AWS Budget (before) vs AWS Cost Explorer (After)
